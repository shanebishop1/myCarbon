## Inspiration
As climate change continues to worsen, we recognize the need to help others become more aware of their impact on the environment.

## What it does
Our mobile application allows users to track their carbon footprint using a daily scoring metric. By inputting daily energy usage across multiple categories, users can see approximately how much carbon they produce. The app then suggests actionable steps to reduce their carbon footprint based on their energy usage. 

## How we built it
We used the Swift programming language in the Xcode platform to develop the application and its logic. We used Adobe Illustrator to design the visuals for the app.
